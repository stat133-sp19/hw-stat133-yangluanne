The purpose of this assignment is to analyze shot data of 5 Golden State Warriors and  write a report narrating the resulting statistics. In addition, students will get to practice working with complex file structures, file paths, different types of files, table manipulation, visualization techniques/principles, and using packages such as dplyr and ggplot2. Analysis of the data will include producing summary texts and graphs called 'shot charts'. All the files used and produced in this assignment will be uploaded to GitHub.
